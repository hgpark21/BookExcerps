Using the CLP : The Apps

*** VIM

Vim is a 'modal' editor, meaning: you move around in one mode, type text in another mode and visually select things in a third mode.

*** EMACS

* Wordgrinder	a word processor designed for writers. Easy-to-use menus, the arrow keys work like expected. Just a very few surprises: can make words bold or italic easily right in the text. Not very customizable; it works pretty much as it comes. There aren't any plug-ins or fancy themes. However, it's reliable, simple to use.
